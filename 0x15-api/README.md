# Introduction to APIs

APIs, or Application Programming Interfaces, are a fundamental part of modern software development. They allow different software systems to communicate and interact with each other, enabling developers to leverage the functionality of existing applications and services.

## What is an API?

At its core, an API is a set of rules and protocols that define how different software components should interact with each other. It provides a way for developers to access and use the functionality of a particular software system, such as retrieving data, performing actions, or integrating with other applications.

## Types of APIs

There are several types of APIs, each serving a specific purpose:

1. **Web APIs**: These APIs are designed to be accessed over the internet using standard web protocols such as HTTP. They allow developers to interact with web services, retrieve data from remote servers, and perform various operations.

2. **Library APIs**: Library APIs, also known as SDKs (Software Development Kits), provide a collection of pre-built functions and classes that developers can use to build applications. These APIs are typically specific to a programming language or framework.

3. **Operating System APIs**: Operating system APIs provide a way for developers to interact with the underlying operating system. They allow applications to access system resources, such as file systems, network interfaces, and hardware devices.

## Benefits of APIs

APIs offer several benefits to developers and businesses:

- **Code Reusability**: APIs allow developers to reuse existing code and functionality, saving time and effort in development.

- **Integration**: APIs enable different applications and services to seamlessly integrate with each other, creating a more connected and efficient software ecosystem.

- **Scalability**: By exposing specific functionality through APIs, software systems can scale and handle increased usage without affecting the overall performance.

- **Flexibility**: APIs provide developers with the flexibility to choose the best tools and technologies for their specific needs, as they can easily integrate with external services and libraries.

## Conclusion

APIs play a crucial role in modern software development, enabling developers to build powerful and interconnected applications. Whether it's accessing data from a remote server, integrating with third-party services, or leveraging pre-built functionality, APIs provide the necessary tools and protocols to make it happen.

By understanding the basics of APIs and how they work, developers can unlock a world of possibilities and create innovative solutions that leverage the power of existing software systems.

# Background Context

Old-school system administrators usually only know Bash and that is what they use to build their scripts. While Bash is perfectly fine for a lot of things, it can quickly get messy and not efficient compared to other programming languages. The new generation of system administrators, usually called SREs, are pretty much regular software engineers but instead of building products, they are managing systems. And one of the big differences with their predecessors is that they know more than just Bash scripting.

One popular way to expose an application and dataset is to use an API. Often, they are the public facing part of websites and micro-services so that allow outsiders to interact with them – access and modify their data. In this project, you will access employee data via an API to organize and export them to different data structures.

This is a perfect example of a task that is not suited for Bash scripting, so let’s build Python scripts.
